            <p>
                This website has been created by Charles Howarth on the <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">CodeNation</a> course run at South Trafford College.
                It goes through some concepts involved in Digital Project design, development and implentation.
            </p>      
            
            <p>
                The topics covered include:- 

                <ul>
                    <li>The purpose of IT in Modern Business</li>
                    <li>Methods, Skills and Resources used in Digital Projects</li>
                    <li>Risks associated with Digital Projects</li>
                    <li>Principles behind selecting the right technology for Digital Projects</li>
                    <li>Legal Issues involved with Digital Projects</li>
                    <li>Constraints and Acessibility Issues</li>
                    <li>Appropriate File Types to be used within Digital Projects</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    I have also included an 'About Me' section.
                </p>    
                    
                <p>
                    I have spent some time looking into the extra attributes that HTML and CSS
                    allow to be specified so this website can look a little more like those we are all used to seeing online.
