                IT Project management is essential to deliver successful projects. Trello is a very useful tool to plan
                and monitor projects throughout their life cycle. It assists with visibility for all members of a project team. Effeciency, productivity and stability are improved by incorporating an industry standard structured
                approach to development. Team capacity and customer demand can be managed and aligned more quickly with tools such as

                Relevant development skills will be required to make projects succeed.

                Slack is the communication tool of preference for the IT industry.
                Slack relies on channels and DM's as the two main methods of communications. Channels allow posts to be hash
                tagged
                so that they are organised in a way that allows users to filter in relevant posts. DM's or Direct Messages
                allow for
                users to connect on an individual basis. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/428046/what-is-slack-and-why-do-people-love-it/" target="_blank">What is Slack ?</a>

            <p>
                For the development of this website I have used Trello. It is used to break down tasks into individual
                components, and these have been tracked through the stages of development (to do, doing, text version created, incorporated into website,tested).
