            <h1>Assignment 1 - 1.7 Legal Issues Associated with Digital Projects</h1>

            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation" target="_blank">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) is EU legislation covering the use of personal data.
                If you process the personal data of EU citizens or residents then the GDPR applies to you. the fines for violating the GDPR are
                extremely high so compliance is essential.
            </p>    
                
            <p>
                There are several principles underlining the GDPR:-
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.</li>
                <li>Purpose limitation — You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.</li>
                <li>Data minimisation — You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.</li>
                <li>Accuracy — You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.</li>
                <li>Storage limitation — You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.</li>
                <li>Integrity and confidentiality — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).</li>
                <li>Accountability — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>            
                <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/" target="_blank">What is the GDPR ?</a>              
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Any digital project has to follow the above principles. For example regular data cleansing will need to take place to satisfy "Storage limitation".
                Therefore the means to identify and remove data that is no longer needed has to be defined and implemented.
