                2.1 & 2.2 - Review of the ongoing use of IT tools
            </h3>

            <p>
                Visual Code editor has been very useful indeed in the creation of HTML and CSS code. Ther autofill,
                alignment and colour coding are all very useful elements that make code extremly easy to read.
            </p>

            <p>
                Trello has been a very simple and effective means of keeping track of the project build items. It is very easy to apply to the Kanban method means it is in line with industry standards.               
            </p>

            <p>
                The use of Github to regularly upload code to a safe place for backup and version control purposes has been very useful.
            </p>

            <p>
                All tools selected for the website were appropriate to the task they were selected for. I found all the above to be simple and intuitive tools, and I encountered no significant problems during their use.
            </p>

            <h3 id="2.3">
                2.3 Review of Website
            </h3>

            <p>
                I am pleased with the look and feel of the website. Certain elements of the website were developed prior to me learning about CSS so these need some redesign to utilise CSS in a better manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Strengths of my website are that it is quite simply laid out. 
                The text is readable and the navigation is simple and quick.
                There are images used to assist quick understanding of what the topics that are covered in most sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weaknesses of the website are that it is essentially quite narrow in scope. The brief for this website was quite specific and 
                I only had a small window of time in which to learn HTML and CSS so the results will reflect these limitations.
            </p>

            <h3 id="2.4">
                2.4 Further Improvements
            </h3>

            <p>
                The website could be restructured to minimise the amount of classes that I declared. The fact that the design changed in the middle
                of building the site as new CSS techniques were acquired, especially flexbox, resulted in some less streamlines code than I would have liked.
                With more time I could make some improvements so that the review page would scroll up and down without requiring the user to click within the text.
            </p>

            <h3 id="2.5">
                2.5 Outcome Review
            </h3>

            <p>
                The planning and creation of the website generally went very well. As I learned about CSS the scope of the website itself increased
                from what I had originally planned, since CSS opened up many possibilities that I had not been in a position to consider previously.
                Features like static navbars were not originally planned, but I researched and was able to deliver competent solutions.
                Assigning styles to things like the navbar, paragraphs and heading also allowed for a consistent look and feel across the site.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Unit 1 Outcome 3
            </h2>

            <h3 id="3.1">
                3.1 Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in website development
            </h3>

            <p>
                The benefits of Trello are that it provides a user friendly method of keeping track of project development. 
                I have not encountered any drawbacks to Trello that are not able to be fixed within the software, e.g. if the 
                project needs a testing phase then adding a list for testing will allow Trello to keep track of that activity. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Visual studio code is a very simple and powerful tool for creating HTML and CSS code. The benefits include
                the autofill and auto-indent functions that allow code to be written quickly and tidily respectively. The colour coding
                provides an extra layer of readability.
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML and CSS are proven tools for Website development and it seems that any drawbacks associated with them, which to me stem from me having insufficient experience with the software,
                are far outweighed by the benefits of these tools.
            <p>

                3.2-3.3 Methods to improve productivity and efficiency
            </h3>

            <p>
                Teamwork definitely allows for more work to be done more quickly by definition. Obviously the team has to be managed
                and the work had to be divided up in a logical manner. So for instance one person could have been assigned to research 
                answers to the topics, and another to look into CSS to find the method to achieve the cleanest and most attractive design for the site.
            </p>

            <h3 id="3.4">
                3.4 Testing Digital Software
            </h3>

            <p>
                The testing of digital software is entirely dependant on the complexity involved in the software. If the software has lots of if..else conditions embedded within it
                then there will need to be a plan drawn up to test each combination of variables so all permutations are tested. When it comes to websites on the internet then plans
                need to be made to ensure the site can handle multiple different browsers and devices.
