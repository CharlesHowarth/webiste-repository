            <h1>1.5 Website Constraints</h1>

            <h2>Constraints</h2>
    
            <p>
                Copyright is a potential source of risk for website development. Areas of potential copyright infringement include:-
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Images</li>
                <li>Source Code</li>
                <li>Platform Licensing</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                Images that are not free stock photos may be picked up by copyright detection tools, and if they are then the website
                may be subject to a copyright claim against it. The actual source code behind websites can be subject to the same risks.
                Some applications may be included within a website under a license. If the scope of the implementation exceeds the terms
                of the license for the application then that becomes another source of risk.
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other constraints include bearing in mind that the website may be visited on a number of different devices (eg laptop, phone,
                tablet) and the site should work for as many devices as possible.
            </p>

            <h2>1.6 Accessibility</h2>

                    Visual Impairment can make reading websites a problem for some. Font size, style and colour selections can make text easier to read. Obviously blindness means that many people cannot read websites for themselves, so screen readers can assist the blind. Audio commentary may be needed to assist with video content.
            </p>

            <p>
                For those with a hearing impairment, Subtitles on any audio content will assist them to consume a website's content.
                People who struggle to use mouse and/or keyboard will need tabbing around a screen to work smoothly. People who find reading difficult will find it easier to read websites if large blocks of text are broken up.
