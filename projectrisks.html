            <h1>Assignment 1 - 1.4 Digital Project Risks</h1>
            <p>
                There are various reasons behind digital projects failing. A recent <a href="https://www.digitaldoughnut.com/articles/2018/september/why-digital-projects-fail" target="_blank">survey</a> revealed that digital risk is a very widespread problem with
                97% of companies surveyed reporting that they had experienced digital project failure. Digital failure is strongly linked to the company's
                overall performance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A breakdown of reasons given for failure states that:-

                <ul>
                    <li>51% - short term priorities took precedence leading to project slip</li>
                    <li>46% - unclear vision</li>
                    <li>51% - poor scope definition</li>
                    <li>50% - trying to do too much at once.</li>
                    <li>39.5% - poor communication/siloing between IT and marketing</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                what is clear from researching this area is that project definition cannot be vague, as a lack of specificity leads to many problems. Also
                if the resources that deal with current business processes are being asked to implement new systems while performing their existing full time tasks,
                then this can be a major source of risk
            </p>

            <p>
                Cyber security is a constant risk that all digital projects face. A cyber security risk assessment is a useful tool to identify and mitigate
                areas of risk.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                Steps to assess risk include
    
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine information value</li>
                    <li>Identify and prioritise assets</li>
                    <li>Identify threats</li>
                    <li>Identify vulnerabilities</li>
                    <li>Analyse controls and implement new controls</li>
                    <li>Calculate the likelihood and impact of various scenarios on a per-year basis</li>
                    <li>Prioritise risks based on the cost of prevention vs information value</li>
                    <li>Document results in risk assessment report</li>
                </ol>
