            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I have a background in IT that stretches back to 1984. I have worked extensively with relational databases
                and have worked for big name firms such as Unisys, and a developer role with the Irish Gas Board (Bord Gais) where I was given resposibilities for very important projects. I had to take some time away from the world of IT for
                family reasons, but recently decided to use <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/">CodeNation</a> to help me refresh my skills for the modern
                workplace. I have learnt some Python basics which I have put to use successfully within the course.

                This website is the first that I have created. I am using HTML commands and CSS styles to create the contents
